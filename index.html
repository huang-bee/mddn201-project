		<h1>Seeing Networks in Wellingotn City</h1>
		<p class="intro">Wellington’s network infrastructure is a lot like the city itself: messy, sprawling, and at times near-incomprehensible. However, the city’s tendency toward flux is a strange blessing for the infrastructure sightseer: markings and remnants of the network are almost everywhere, once you know how to look for them.</p>

		<p class="introspace">I went around Wellington CBD looking for all different types of internet infrastructure. I most commonly came across powerlines, cables, security cameras and manholes on the streets and roads. I only found a few antennas, road markings and satellite dishes. I never realised how much internet infrastructures surrounds us and how much we rely on them to connect to the rest of the world.</p>

		<p class="text"> Antennas' or sometimes called aerials are metal rods and dishes that recieve radio waves and converts them into electrical signals. The is so it can be fed into electronics like tc, radio and phones. 

		
		<p class="text">Antennas' are neccessary for telecomminication. The internet is provided through cables and cords and the Antenna provides a variety of wireless networking. You are most likely to find antennas on the roof of residential homes because this allows them to connect to television networks, phone systems and more.</p>

		<p class="text"> Electrical cable will probably the most common form of internet infrastructure you will see around Wellington. The purpose of cables are to connect two or more devices together so that electrical signals can be tranferred between them. Cable are also used to power one device to the other. They are used for a wide range of purpose but are extensively used in electronic devices for power and signal circuits.

		<p class="text">	
		The cables you see around wellington are most likely installed to create a faster and more stable connection to a larger system such as connecting to the internet.</p>

		<p class="text"> Similar to the Antenna, this infrastructure is used to recieve or transmit information by radio waves. Instead of a rod this tranimitter is a dish-shaped type of parabolic antenna. This dish is most commonly used to recieve direct-broadcast tv. 

		<p class="text">The bowl shaped surface is the central feed horn. To transmit a signal, the controller sends it through the horn (the rod sticking out of the dish) and the dish focuses the signal into a narrow beam. You can also connect to the internet via satellite dish and can be sometimes preferred because it can handle high bandwidth.</p>

		<p class="text">Manholes are often used as the access point to a underground public utility system. It is important to have these underground access points because this allows inspections, maintenance and system upgrades. Some of these underground services include water, sewage, telephone, electricty, drainage, heating and gas systems.</p>

		<p class="text">Below these manholes are cables connecting networks to our homes and the data is sent to and from our property which connects us to the rest of the world.</p>

		<p class="text"> A power line is a tall structure, usually found on the footpaths is an electrical power transmitter and distributor. These are used to transmit electrical energy across large distances. Power lines consist of one or more unisulated cables suspended by a power or pole. </p>

		<p class="text">You can see these powerlines everywhere because they connect you to everything. They facilitate every form of network we have and they give electrcity to power daily tools and electrionics such as your computer, fridge and more. They also have phone lines which connect landlines which allows you to make a phone call anywhere in the world.</p>

		<p class="text">Security cameras and CCTV (closed circuit television) uses video cameras to monitor the interior and exterior of a property. The camera transmit the signal to a connected (set of) monitors.</p>

		<p class="text">
		These have become more common over the past few years because it is quite beneficial. These cameras help deter criminal activityand increase a sense of security. These cameras are found in public places, recording our daily lives. The recordings and information are sent to wider networks which connects us to those systems.</p>
